# Accountants-Website--demo
This is a demo accontant website that offers several services. The basic function of the website is to fetch the information of the clients via forms and getting them into the admin panel so that company's operator can provide services.Instructions of the URL direct requests are in the README file.

To Check for the admin panel type 
localhost:5000/admin

enter email address : m.talhas0777@gmail.com
password: admin4455

just click on the consult requests and check all the data behind the scenes.

In this website I have used 
Bootstrap 5 as a frontend framework for UI with an EJS as a view Engine.
For the Backend I have used MongoDB as a Non-Relational Database. Express as framework or library in node.JS.

Note:(The header.ejs is a file in the partials. If we dont use REACT.JS so it is recommended to use partials in our project to simplify our reoccuring parts of the website such as headers and footers and anything like them that reoccures.)
